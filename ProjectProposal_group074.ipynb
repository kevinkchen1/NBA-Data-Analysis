    "Some definitions of factors that we might research with our question and their definitions include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Field-goal shooting percentage: The percentage of field goals made by a team out of the total number of field goals attempted. \n",
    "* Three-point shooting percentage: The percentage of three-point field goals made by a team out of the total number of three-point field goals attempted. \n",
    "* Free-throw shooting percentage: The percentage of free throws made by a team out of the total number of free throws attempted. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Offensive rebounds: The number of rebounds made by a team in the opponent's half of the court. \n",
    "* Assists: The number of passes made by a team that lead to a successful field goal attempt by a teammate. \n",
    "Turnovers: The number of times a team loses possession of the ball without attempting a field goal. \n",
    "Free-throws attempted: The number of free throws attempted by a team.\n",
    "* Relative Annual Score: There may be a noticeable/significant difference among factors that contribute to victory from year to year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first source, which focuses on college basketball, identifies four significant factors that contribute to victory in college basketball games. These factors include differences in assists, differences in free throw attempts, differences in defensive rebounds, and differences in turnovers. Among these, turnovers were found to have the most substantial effect on game outcomes, followed by defensive rebounds and assists. The study utilized statistical methods such as logistic and least squares regression to analyze the data. This source provided helpful information on college basketball and a general framework for our analysis of NBA games.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second source selected seven key statistics that significantly influence the outcome of NBA games, including field-goal shooting percentage, three-point shooting percentage, free-throw shooting percentage, offensive rebounds, assists, turnovers, and free-throws attempted. These statistics were used to develop models for predicting point spreads and estimating the probability of a specific NBA team winning. The models exhibited high accuracy, ranging from 88% to 94%, when applied to a sample of 50 NBA games from the 2011-2012 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining insights from both sources, we can infer that in addition to the four factors identified in college basketball, metrics related to shooting accuracy (field-goal, three-point, and free-throw percentages) and offensive rebounds play essential roles in determining an NBA team's success. To address our research question, we will incorporate public data about NBA games and follow the statistics recorded based on each official game.\n",
    "\n",
    "A worry that we might need to address is the potential difference in these factors from year to year. For example one year might have championship victory with a team that has a higher value in one factor compared to another year, say Three-point shooting percentage. This might just be because every team improved on their 3 pointers that year and the championship winner's actually have quite an average Three-point percentage, but won because their Free-throw shooting percentage was just better compared to the rest of their year. Basically if the difference between years are significant it may be better to look at how much better the championship team was compared to the rest of the teams that year rather than hard numbers without context.\n",

    "Our hypothesis is that based on the performance of NBA teams from the years 2018 to 2023, the most important factor in determining whether a team wins the NBA championships is the field goal percentage. We believe that this is the case as it most likely contributes the most amount of points and allows a team to win by outscoring their adversaries. A high field goal percentage would indicate that the team is efficient at scoring and can score more points when given the opportunity to.\n",

We believe that field goal percentage has the greatest impact on winning the championship because it significantly affects a team's ability to outscore the opponent. A high field goal percentage indicates efficient scoring, meaning more points scored. A high field goal percentage also shows that a team is maximizing their scoring opportunities as they are gaining points when given the opportunity to be on offense and take shots.\n",

    "Our ideal dataset would have a history of the statistics associated with different teams’ performance. Our group would need statistical data on game results throughout NBA seasons from 2018-2023 across all teams. The data won’t have bias because it will be sampled from the hundreds of games that are played in each season. The dataset would need to have a wide range of factors to analyze, including field goal percentage so we could test if these factors have a correlation with a team’s chances of winning. Other factors we need in the dataset include three point percentages, defensive performance and free throw percentages, as these are the most commonly measured game statistics when looking at which team performed better and won. These could be obtained from NBA game summary reports and sports industry companies such as ESPN and Bleacher Report, as they record and track data from each game that is played.\n",

    "### Biases:\n",
    "* Team Bias: Team members of the research group might have personal biases for or against certain teams or players. For example a research group might want to choose years that favor a certain team that they like which affects the outcome of our experiment as it favors that team’s playstyle. We're raising awareness to educate our team members about unconscious biases. This will involve role-playing exercises, where team members argue from perspectives opposite their own, fostering empathy and reducing personal biases. This can be further enforced by ensuring that other members of the team review and confirm the results in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sampling Bias: When collecting data, we will make sure to get sampling without biases, by analyzing data from all NBA teams throughout each season. This removes selective sampling, ensuring that no teams are left out. We also chose a set of intervals to sample from so that data collected from teams are not only specific to any favorite teams or players they might have for a certain season. Collecting data from all NBA teams in the most recent years means that all teams are factored in when answering our research question and that we are using the most recent historical data to give us accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Bias: Like mentioned in sampling bias, we will ensure that the data we collected is not biased as the data we are analyzing is across all NBA teams and not only specific to any favorite teams or players our group members might have. We also have limited data bias by getting historical data from the NBA website itself which is accurate and has up to date information on NBA game statistics from each year. This minimizes bias as we will be analyzing the actual game statistics that were recorded and not influenced by outside sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics\n",
    "* Consent: We generally will not have to worry about informed consent, because we are not surveying and interviewing participants to obtain our data. Instead, all of this data is online and is open access, meaning that the data we are using has been approved for public usage. Also, NBA teams and players are aware that their game statistics are available online and can be seen by anyone, because the NBA is widely followed across the world. Therefore, we can use this public data to perform our analysis without worrying about consent. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Privacy/Ownership: As we are not collecting this data from participants, but instead using the data from a public source, we are not directly responsible for the NBA teams and player’s data. To ensure data privacy during our research process, we will make sure to stop using data in our analysis if a team or player ever announces that they don’t want their data publicly available online. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithmic Bias / Discrimination: Our algorithm could potentially discriminate against other aspects of basketball like fouls, rule changes, players. We can fix this by introducing new features in the dataset and adjusting it to ensure for a more comprehensive study.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transparency: Issues regarding transparency include the lack of clarity, or visibility in our statistical methods and analysis. How we can address this is by ensuring that our analysis is public for anyone to see. We can create a public-facing resource to detail all steps taken to reach the conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unintended Consequences: Unintended consequences of our findings could be that teams might use the information to value themselves and it can also be used to value players. Our research can also change team play styles and coaching direction, to adapt for our findings. How we can address this is by emphasizing how we come up with our findings and emphasizing that players play a significant role in which team does better. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Continued Monitoring / Accountability: Statistics can potentially be updated as more and more games and seasons are played throughout the year. However, the intervals/years that we chose to take our data from is static/constant so monitoring is not an issue. To check for future biases we can include more features to account for and/or increase our sample size from 5 years to 10. "
