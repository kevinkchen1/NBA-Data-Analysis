    "The National Basketball Association or NBA for short is a professional basketball league which was established in the United States in the year of 1949 after a merger of two rival basketball associations. Since then, the NBA has grown significantly and is a major professional sporting league in the United States. The current NBA consists of three divisions with 30 teams in total split across two conferences and three divisions. Every season of the NBA, there is a championship held where the most successful teams from each conference play against each other (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first lay down some basketball definitions which are important for understanding our question and the subsequent work:\n",
    "* Field-goal: A field goal is a point scored by ordinarily playing the game which can be worth either 2 or 3 points depending on distance.\n",
    "* Field-goal percentage: This is the percentage of successful field goals made by a team out of the total attempted field goals.\n",
    "* Three-point shooting percentage: This is the total number of successful three-point field goals made by a team out of the total attempted three-point field goals.\n",
    "* Free-throw: A free-throw or foul shot is an unopposed shot worth 1 point taken at an area on the basketball court known as the free-throw line and is generally given to players who have been fouled by the opposing team similar to how penalty shots work in other sports.\n",
    "* Free-throw shooting percentage: This is the number of successful free-throws over the number of total free-throws taken.\n",
    "* Rebound: This is when the ball is recoverred from a missed field goal or free throw.\n",
    "* Defensive rebound: This is the number of total rebounds made when in the defending team's half of the basketball court.\n",
    "* Offensive rebound: This is the number of total rebounds made when in the attacking/opponent's half of the basketball court.\n",
    "* Assists: This statistic is the number of immediate passes made which led to the a successful field goal.\n",
    "* Turnovers: These are the number of times a team loses possession of the ball without attempting a field goal.\n",
    "* Relative Annual Score: There may be a noticeable/significant difference among factors that contribute to victory from year to year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first paper written by Rhonda Magel and Samuel Unruh in 2013 primarily focuses on the NCAA or college-level basketball. This study identified four main factors which contributed the most to a team winning a game. These four attributes were differences in assists, differences in free-throw attempts, differences between defensive rebounds, and differences between turnovers. Amongst these four statistics, the study found that the turnovers were the most important in determining whether a team would win a game. This was determined by utilizing statistical methods such as logistic and least squares regression in order to analyze the data. Overall, this source demonstrates that there are indeed factors which contribute to a team winning or losing a basketball game; however, this source focuses on the NCAA and not the NBA (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second paper written by Eric Scot Jones instead focuses on the NBA and has seven key statistics which are used for determining the outcome of NBA games including the following: including field-goal shooting percentage, three-point shooting percentage, free-throw shooting percentage, offensive rebounds, assists, turnovers, and free-throws attempted. These statistics were then analyzed for predicting point spreads and determining the probability of a certain NBA team from winning a game. Said modoels exhibited high accuracy and had a 88% to 94% success rate when applied to games from the 2011-2012 season (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, both sources present numerous statistics for each basketball team and highlight factors which were deemed important for allowing teams to win. We can utilize both of these sources to further construct a well-defined research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "A worry that we might need to address is the potential difference in these factors from year to year. For example one year might have championship victory with a team that has a higher value in one factor compared to another year, say Three-point shooting percentage. This might just be because every team improved on their 3 pointers that year and the championship winner's actually have quite an average Three-point percentage, but won because their Free-throw shooting percentage was just better compared to the rest of their year. Basically if the difference between years are significant it may be better to look at how much better the championship team was compared to the rest of the teams that year rather than hard numbers without context.\n",

    "Our hypothesis is that based on the performance of NBA teams from the years 2018 to 2023, the most important factor in determining whether a team wins the NBA championships is the field goal percentage. We believe that this is the case as it most likely contributes the most amount of points and allows a team to win by outscoring their adversaries. A high field goal percentage would indicate that the team is efficient at scoring and can score more points when given the opportunity to.\n",

We believe that field goal percentage has the greatest impact on winning the championship because it significantly affects a team's ability to outscore the opponent. A high field goal percentage indicates efficient scoring, meaning more points scored. A high field goal percentage also shows that a team is maximizing their scoring opportunities as they are gaining points when given the opportunity to be on offense and take shots.\n",

    "The ideal dataset would contain the history of teams and their statistics. Our group would need the statistical data for every game's results throughout the NAB seasons beginning from 2018 to 2023 for all teams within the league. This numerical data would need to be correct and unaltered. The dataset would need to be large enough to not only include the outcome and score of the game, but also the statistics for different factors we want to analyze such as field goal percentages, rebounds, and turnovers. In the event that the data is incomplete, the ideal dataset would consist of multiple sources which can be aggregated to create the ideal dataset. This data can be easily obtained directly from the NBA game summary reports and sports industry  companies such as ESPN and or the Bleacher report as they track and record data for every single game that is played.\n",

Team statistics variables include team wins, team losses, and average team score per game. The website also includes team and game statistics including date, opponent, result (Win/Loss), points scored, and points allowed. \n",

Another potential obstacle would be that the data may not be formatted in a manner which is computer-friendly for analysis.

Instead, all of the data was already publically available and online before even conducting the study. In addition, NBA players statistics are available for public viewing so consent becomes a non-issue.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Algorithmic Bias/Discriminator: The results of the study may include discriminatory factors depending on other more human aspects of basketball such as fouls, rule changes, or discrimination against certain players. This can be resolved by further investigating the data and potentially introducing new features or altering/removing that part of the dataset entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transparency: All parts of this project will be transparent and public-facing. All steps used to obtain the final conclusion will be detailed and explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unintended Consequences: Both individuals and teams could potentially use the results of this project for personal gain. For example, a team could utilize the conclusion of the project and try to maximize the factors which result in game victories or a sports better may utilize the project in attempt for financial gain. The only possible way for this is to emphasize that the project exists for finding important factors but that it may not be completely accurate as all players in the team play a significant role to their success."
